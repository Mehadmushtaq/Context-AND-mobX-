##MobX

MobX is an open source state management tool.
MobX is standalone and does not depend on any frontend library or framework to work. There are implementations of the MobX in popular front-end frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.

In addition to being a library, MobX also introduces a few concepts: state, actions, and derivations (including reactions and computed values).

**actions**
In MobX, actions are methods that manipulate and update the state. These methods can be bound to a JavaScript event handler to ensure a UI event triggers them.
